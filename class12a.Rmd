* Some people successfully ran the code, but many ran into problems.

* Many problems arose with packages: even getting the right version of *pomp* may not be enough, because of potential interactions with R versions and other package versions.

* Conclusion: publishing code is helpful, but it may still take some work and adaptation to run it on your system.

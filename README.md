Class materials for Stats 810 Fall 2015, a proseminar on responsible scientific conduct and research methods

This material is being experimentally placed on github. 
Reproducibility and scientific openness are recurrent themes in the course, so it makes sense to learn to practice them. 
Putting the materials on github is a step in that direction.

The materials here are also on the [course website](http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~ionides/810/).
